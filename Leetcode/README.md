I didn't solve the exos in C ++ or Python based on an analysis of the problem.
It's just that I was already used to Python so I wanted to get used to C ++ as well.
So you will notice that the first few exercises I did in Python but then started 
using C++.. So just a note in case you think the decision was problem specific.
